# Hello, I'm Victoria Chen. 
I hope to be a programmer, so I thought I better store some of my little projects and old assignments for reference and portfolio sake.

I have been studying computer science in Waikato University. I initially went into the uni with a scholarship in Graphic Design, but through a mandatory C# paper I found what I really enjoyed most and changed my degree.
