	<h1>Welcome to Hamilton Hotel - actually a motel</h1>
	<p>We're actually a motel, not a hotel, but the logo looks cooler when it says hotel. And since this is an imaginary, made up place, we won't get into trouble for this. Right? Regardless of Hs or Ms, we provide comfortable stays at our high quality rooms, all at a reasonable price. We offer three different types of rooms to suit your needs for your stay and the best you could ask for in service, providing the optimal comfort for your needs at the end of the day.</p>

	<h1>Reaching Hamilton Hotel</h1>
	<p>Being located in a centralised Hamilton area, we are easy to find following some prominent landmarks! Here are some easy to remember directions if you are looking for us, but lost your handy GPS.</p>
	<h3>Waikato Museum</h3>
	<p>From Waikato Museum, look around to see where the sign for Madeup Street is, and follow down that street. Continue walking down until you see Totes Real Street, and turn down that street. Take the turn right when you see the cookie shop, which will be after one set of lights, and our motel will be there on the left waiting for you! </p>
	<h3>Hamilton Gardens</h3>
	<p>From the main entry of Hamilton Gardens, walk past the giant bird sign and make a turn left down That Road. Look for the giant pet shop down that road, which is at the corner of another street to turn into. Drive past two sets of lights, then turn left and take the third exit in the roundabout. Our motel will be on the right of the street!</p>
